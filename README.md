# RSVP-Movie-Case-Study

## Problem Statement
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

As a data analyst and an SQL expert, we have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For our convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables.

## Datasets
This case study contains following files:
* IMDb+movies+Data+and+ERD+final.xlsx - This file contains the tables and the ERD diagram to help you understand the relationship between those tables.
* IMDB+dataset+import.sql - This contains all the commands and data required for the database creation using the Excel sheet above. We can run this script to load the data on the MySQL workbench and start with the querying exercises on the database.

## Case study Files
* SQL Script File: The question SQL script file given with the final codes (answers) written in it. This will be our solution file.
* Executive Summary: Write the executive summary consisting of the important insights derived from the data and some recommendations to be given to RSVP movies for their project (not exceeding 250 words) saved as PDF.
